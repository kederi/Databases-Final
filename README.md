# Databases-Final
Here is the final project for the Databases class which required crafting a Job Shop database with SQL queries and then implementing a Java Program to run those queries, and finally creating a JSP application with a Frontend User interface. 

## A Forewarning 

The application will not be able to access the Database any longer since my License for Azure has run out

## Problem 
Given the problem description of a Job Shop that has multiple different components, create a functioning database using an ER model and implement specified queries on that database.

## Solution 
Create a ER diagram for a job shop then utilize SQL queries to construct the mapped out tables. After this use the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to the database and implement queries on the tables. Finally for sake of useability create a web interface using JSP that allows a user to more easily run queries on the database.
