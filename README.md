# Databases-Final
Here is the final project for the Databases class which required crafting a Job Shop database with SQL queries and then implementing a Java Program to run those queries, and finally creating a JSP application with a Frontend User interface. 

## A Forewarning 

The application will not be able to access the Database any longer since my License for Azure has run out
